|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Sepolia           | `0x047e55D4c0C70C973a5c2254e6d80c154A06899B` |
| Holesky           | `0xC8Ed6AC1F5af1Ce991a94eEf8Ae2d979e26d96a5` |

## Important Notes

1. **Bet Amount**:
   - Each contract has a limited amount of ETH (0.03 ETH or 30,000,000 Gwei).
   - **Do not bet more than 0.03 ETH** in a single transaction, as the transaction will fail due to insufficient contract balance.

2. **Testnet Only**:
   - This app is deployed on testnets only. Use testnet ETH for betting.
   - Real ETH is not supported or required.

3. **Faucet Limitations**:
   - Testnet faucets have daily limits. Use them wisely to get testnet ETH for betting.

4. **Supported Chains**:
   - The app supports the following testnets:
     - Sepolia
     - Holesky
     - Arbitrum Sepolia
     - Base Sepolia
     - Optimism Sepolia

5. **Transaction Status**:
   - Transactions can have three statuses:
     - **Pending**: The transaction is being processed.
     - **Success**: The transaction was successful.
     - **Failed**: The transaction failed (e.g., due to insufficient contract balance or network issues).

## Troubleshooting

1. **Transaction Fails**:
   - Ensure you are connected to the correct testnet.
   - Ensure you have enough testnet ETH in your wallet.
   - Do not bet more than 0.03 ETH in a single transaction.

2. **MetaMask Connection Issues**:
   - Refresh the page and reconnect your wallet.
   - Ensure MetaMask is unlocked and connected to the correct network.

3. **App Not Loading**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
   - Check the browser console for errors.
